# Traffic Light System

### Overview
This project implements heartbeat tactic to monitor Traffic Light using a Heartbeat Monitor process. The crash in TrafficLightControlSys is non-deterministic because it has a 20% random probability in each of the loop. And if monitor didn't revice the traffic light switch in 5 second then will crash. The traffic light should switch different color in 2 second.
